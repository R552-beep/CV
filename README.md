<h1 align="center"> Ruzeka Uddin - Junior Software Developer </h1>

I am an ambitious and driven Junior Software Developer looking for a role where I can develop and continue to grow whilst learning within the tech industry. My passion for software development led me to leave my established career as a Senior Sales Executive within the property sector to pursue a more fulfilling and creative career path.

My career transition began with a highly selective Bootcamp, Makers Academy, where I learned how to implement best coding practices and fundamental programming concepts. Additionally, the Bootcamp's nature helped me effectively self-manage my transition.

I am a technology enthusiast driven to learn and further develop my skills, testing new concepts and solving problems using analytical approaches. My innate curiosity will help me spot opportunities to solve problems. The world of modern technology keeps me both motivated and committed.

## Soft Skills

#### Communication 
I have effectively communicated and negotiated with many stakeholders, customers and marketing team members in my previous role. In addition, I have worked on complex projects where there were delays and land issues on a large scale, including a written update to my customers and a detailed report to the head of sales with strategies to overcome the problem. These skills have proven helpful in the Makers Academy team projects, especially when coding in a pair. You must not only confidently express your ideas regarding a project but also listen carefully to others. It has developed my ability to solve problems collaboratively and further enhanced my communicative style. When working within a group or pairing environment, I can effectively articulate project needs and resolve challenges when working within a group or pairing environment.

#### Collaboration
Throughout my professional career and during Makers Bootcamp, I have demonstrated my dedication to teamwork. My experience has constantly been enriched by working within a team that allows me to work collaboratively and build strong values, which are critical to ensuring a high-performing organisation. I have demonstrated my ability to successfully collaborate within groups to launch projects like Acebook & Makers BnB. Together we provided technical and EQ support throughout both projects. Furthermore, we conducted daily stand-ups and retrospectives at the end of each day to ensure everyone felt heard and to manage our workflow. The fundamentals of teamwork are of great importance to me, and I always strive to develop solid relationships and to display positivity among colleagues. Finally, I have participated in regular pairing sessions with other alumni to continue our learning journey to continue developing my skills.


#### Time Management and Organisation 
My track record of effectively managing time and working under pressure makes me a valuable employee. In addition, my goal to achieve success drives me to be productive, proactive and successful. Throughout my career and at Makers Academy, I have demonstrated my ability to self-manage, be organised and use tools and techniques to meet deadlines, milestones and targets. In my last role, I worked on various challenging projects. I was involved in active selling, product demonstrations, lead generation techniques, increasing sales revenue, and budgeting for and maximising the company's revenue. As a result, I can streamline my workload by prioritising tasks and utilising my time effectively. My organisation skills have further developed through various projects at Makers Academy, particularly my last two group projects.  As part of our agile development process, we used several administrative tools. Such as Trello to manage tickets and observe workflow. Google Drive for documents and resources for our daily stand-up and retros, and Github to manage progress and coordinate workflow. To assist me with my process modelling and note-taking, I have used Miro and Excalidraw.
