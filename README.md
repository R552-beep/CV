<h1 align="center"> Ruzeka Uddin </h1>

A driven and aspiring Junior Software Developer, looking for a role where I can develop and continue to grow whilst learning within the tech industry.
I decided to leave my established career as a Senior Sales Executive within the property sector to pursue my passion in software development and to seek a more fulfilling and creative professional direction.

I began my career change journey with a highly selective bootcamp, [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/) Where I learned to adopt coding best practices and developed a good understanding of programming fundamentals. The nature of the bootcamp enabled me to both effectively self manage during independent projects, as well as collaborate as part of a productive team to produce high quality work.

I thrive to learn and further develop my skills, whilst testing new concepts with analytical drives to see if they work. An innate curiosity will equip me with the skills needed to spot opportunities and solve problems.
The world of modern technology keeps me both motivated and dedicated to working within the industry, where it is already driving meaningful change in almost every major industry.

## Soft Skills

#### Communication 
Is an important skill in any profession - In my previous role I have been able to effectively communicate, advocate and negotiate with a broad range of stakeholders, customers & marketing team. I have worked on complex projects where there were delays and land issues on a large scale, this included a written update to my customers & detailed report to head of sales with strategies to overcome the problem. 
These skills have proven useful in the Makers Academy team projects and specially when coding in a pair. It's essential that you not only confidently express your ideas regarding a project, but also listen carefully to others.

#### Critical Thinker
One key aspect of working as a software developer that I love is: problem solving. My background in sales helped me to develop the skills that I need to be capable of being assertive and delivering solutions to problems. I have found coding to help improve my logical reasoning and decision making abilities.

#### Perseverance and Resilience
When faced with a challenging obstacle, I am the type of person that will commit to spending the time necessary to break it down. When a task seems impossible at first, I do not give up because I believe that if you set your mind on something, you will always be able to achieve it. I think that an essential factor in perseverance and resilience is knowing how important it is to ask for help when you need it. Delaying asking for help can be counterproductive and an ineffective use of time.
