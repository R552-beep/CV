<h1 align="center"> Ruzeka Uddin </h1>

I am a self-motivated and driven Software Developer looking for a role where I can develop and continue to grow whilst learning within the tech industry. I decided to leave my established career as a Senior Sales Executive within the property sector to pursue my passion for software development and seek a more fulfilling and creative professional direction.

I began my career change journey with a highly selective Bootcamp, Makers Academy, Where I learned to adopt coding best practices and developed a good understanding of programming fundamentals. In addition, the nature of the Bootcamp enabled me to effectively self-manage during independent projects and collaborate as part of a productive team to produce high-quality work.

I thrive on learning and further developing my skills, testing new concepts with analytical drives to see if they work. An innate curiosity will equip me with the skills to spot opportunities and solve problems. The world of modern technology keeps me both motivated and dedicated to working within the industry, where it is already driving meaningful change in almost every primary sector.

## Soft Skills

#### Communication 
It is an essential skill in any profession. In my previous role, I have effectively communicated, advocated and negotiated with a broad range of stakeholders, customers & marketing team. In addition, I have worked on complex projects where there were delays and land issues on a large scale, including a written update to my customers & detailed report to the head of sales with strategies to overcome the problem. These skills have proven helpful in the Makers Academy team projects, especially when coding in a pair. You must not only confidently express your ideas regarding a project but also listen carefully to others. This has developed my ability to solve problems collaboratively and further enhanced my communicative style. When working within a group or pairing environment, I can effectively articulate project needs and resolve challenges.

#### Collaboration
I am a dedicated team player, which has been evident throughout my professional career and during my time at Makers Bootcamp. I have always thrived within a team environment that has allowed me to collaborate and build strong values, which I see as vital to ensuring a high-performing organisation. 
During my time at Makers, I have continuously demonstrated an effective collaborative mindset within group environments to create projects such as Acebook & Makers BnB. The team and I provided technical and EQ support throughout the application for both projects. In addition, we ran two daily stand-ups and retrospective catchup at the end of each day to manage our workflow and ensure that everyone felt heard.
I always seek to develop strong relationships, aspire to display positivity amongst colleagues, and strongly value the critical fundamentals of teamwork. I have recently had the opportunity to develop this skillset further, where I have taken on regular pairing sessions with other alumni to continue our learning journey. 


#### Organisation and Time Management
Effective time management and working under pressure are skills that I have excelled at. I am productive, proactive, and committed to achieving success. I'm self-managed, organised and employed tools and techniques to ensure deadlines, milestones and targets are met: this has been showcased through my previous work experience and my time at Makers Academy.
Within my past work experience, my roles included consistently managing  multi-million-pound projects (e.g.https://www.fishislandvillage.co.uk), each project came with its own set of clients and stakeholders;  active selling, product demonstration, lead generation strategy, progressing sales, managing budgets and maximise sales revenue and achieving targets. As a result, I can prioritise tasks and ensure my time is utilised efficiently.
I’ve learnt about the Agile process, similar to how I have worked in previous roles with regular meetings and discussions, where all team members can share their ideas in an open discussion.
My organisational skills have been further established through various projects that I’ve completed, particularly my last two group projects. We used many administrative tools to prioritise agile development. That included Trello, a project board for managing tickets and observing workflow, Google drive, to store our resources and documentation of our daily stand-ups and retros, and GitHub issues to focus on essential tasks and manage workflow simultaneously. Additionally, I've used various tools to assist with my note-taking and process modelling, such as Miro and Excalidraw.
